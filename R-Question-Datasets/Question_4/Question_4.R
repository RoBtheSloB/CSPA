#' Question R4


#' Below are any statements necessary to load in data or libraries 
#' which you will need to answer the question. Should you accidentally 
#' modify any of this code, you may recover it from the file called 
#' 'question1_read_only.R'. Changes should be made in this file only.

#' Note:
#' Question reviewers will only rely on information contained in your script 
#' to grade your answer.  The grader must be able to run the script to recreate 
#' your answer so be sure your script records every relevant action you have taken.  
#' If you execute lines at the console, be sure to copy them to your script if the 
#' commands are necessary in order for your script to work properly.  For example, 
#' if you create an object or variable from the console and then reference that 
#' variable in your script, the script will not run for the grader, since that object 
#' or variable are not created in the script.  When you have completed the question 
#' save your R script (*.R) and R Project (*.Rproj) files.

#' Clear the R Environment

rm(list=ls())

#' Set working directory

setwd("~/Question_4")

#' Load dataset

load("sgautoBI9301.RData")

# Part E.
#
## Suppose the expected loss cost for the 2001 origin year is 1,500,000.
## What is the BF Method estimate of the ultimate loss cost?



#
# Part F.
#
## By comparing the BF method ultimate loss cost for 2001 to that of the Chain Ladder,
## comment on which method the user should select and why.
